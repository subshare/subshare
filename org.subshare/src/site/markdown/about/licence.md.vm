Licence
-------

$H$H$H GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL)

subshare is [Free Software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software) licenced under the conditions of the [AGPL](../license.html).

In short, this means:

* You can use subshare for every purpose.
* You\'re free to study how subshare works, and to change it to make it do what you wish. This implies access to the source codes.
* You can freely (re)distribute subshare.
* You have the freedom to improve subshare, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public,
so that the whole community benefits. This, too, implies access to the source codes.
* If you modify subshare, you must make all your modifications publicly available.
* If you integrate subshare into your own application (including your SaaS), you must make your application publicly available.


$H$H$H Dual-licencing

Do you want to include subshare in your *proprietary* solution without publishing any of your code? Or
do you have other reasons for preferring another licence? Please contact us! We offer dual-licencing.


$H$H$H Contributor licence agreement

By contributing to this project, you accept the conditions of the
[AGPL](../about/licence.html) and also grant the [CodeWizards GmbH](http://codewizards.co) an
irrevocable and non-exclusive permission to work with your contributions. This includes the
right to licence your contributions to third parties under another licence, at the sole discretion
of the CodeWizards. You do *not* give up any right to use your contributions yourself, but you do give up
the right to constrain what the CodeWizards are allowed to do with your contributions.
