Releases
-------

As development continues, CloudStore changes. Hence, we provide the corresponding web-site-version for each release.

Please make sure that you\'re reading the correct documentation for the version you\'re using. You
find the version of the web-site in the footer.

In the following you find a list of all releases:

* [Latest development snapshot](../../latest-dev/) (Not stable & not yet released!)
