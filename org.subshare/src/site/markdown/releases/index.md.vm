Releases
-------

As development continues, subshare changes. For historic reasons, we provide the
corresponding web-site-version for each release.

In the following you find a list of all releases:

* [Latest development snapshot](../../latest-dev/) (Not stable & not yet released!)
* [Latest stable version](../../latest-stable/)
* [1.0.0](../../1.0.0/) (released 2020-02-23)
* [0.10.7](../../0.10.7/) (released 2019-10-06)
* [0.10.6](../../0.10.6/) (released 2018-12-25)
* [0.10.5](../../0.10.5/) (released 2018-08-16)
* [0.10.4](../../0.10.4/) (released 2018-07-14)
* [0.10.3](../../0.10.3/) (released 2017-10-14)
* [0.10.2](../../0.10.2/) (released 2017-09-24)

Older releases (before 0.9.8) were internal tests and didn't have a web-site, yet.


$H$H$H$H Java 11 vs. Java 8

Since version 1.0.0, subshare supports Java 11 and all its JARs contain a <code>module-java.class</code>.

Subshare 1.0.0 works with Java 11 (and newer) only! Java 8 is *not* supported, anymore. Because of this,
we do not automatically update from subshare 0.x.

If you want to use subshare with Java 8, please download the newest 0.x-version!
