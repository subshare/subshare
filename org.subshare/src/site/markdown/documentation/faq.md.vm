Frequently asked questions (FAQ)
-------

$H$H$H What's OpenPGP and why does subshare use it?

$H$H$H What encryption algorithms are used?

$H$H$H What happens in case of a collision?

If you modify the same file on two separate computers and then synchronise, there is - obviously - a collision.
You also run into a collision, if you modify a file on one device and delete it on another (without synchronising
inbetween). There are more situations leading to collisions, of course, but there\'s no need to list them all here.

All collisions are solved in the same way: Both versions are checked-in so that both
are available in the history (and can be restored), a collision-marker is created for the affected file/directory
and shown in the UI (in the directory tree as well as in the history).


$H$H$H What's this "local server"?

Subshare's client program consists of two parts: The graphical user interface (GUI) and the actual logic.
The two parts run in two distinct processes (JVMs), allowing for the GUI to be closed, while the synchronisation
continues to run in the background. 

When you start the GUI process, it automatically launches the so-called *cproc* (client process) with the local server
in the background — if it is not yet running.

The local server opens a randomly chosen TCP port on `localhost` and is thus *not accessible from other computers*.
To protect it further, i.e. to prevent other users on the *same computer* from accessing it, the local server generates
a random password on every startup. This password (together with its port) is stored in `~/.subshare/localServer.properties`
and thus not accessible to other users (if the file system permissions are set correctly).

The user can thus start subshare whenever he logs in into his workstation. After entering his OpenPGP secret key's passphrase,
he can quit the GUI process — the actual synchronisation logic continues to run and keeps everything in-sync.

$H$H$H How can I set log levels?

You can find all logging configuration files in the `~/.subshare` directory.

There are : 

* `logback.client.xml` for the client process
* `logback.localserver.xml` for the client's separate server process
* `logback.server.xml` for the server process
