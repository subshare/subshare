$H$H$H Free Software

subshare is [Free Software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software) released under the [AGPL](../about/licence.html).
Its source codes are hosted [here on GitHub](https://github.com/subshare).

Please feel free to check out the source codes and study them. It\'s a very good idea, anyway, to download the sources
and build the binaries yourself. This is probably the most secure way of using this software, making it extremely
difficult for an attacker to provide malicious code to you.

Furthermore, you are - of course - very welcome to contribute. Please [contact us](../about/contact.html), if you want
to lend us a hand.


$H$H$H Setting up a workspace

$H$H$H$H Step 1: Eclipse

Download and start [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org). The \"Eclipse IDE for Java Developers\" is recommended.


$H$H$H$H Step 2: Git

Open the \"Git Repository Exploring\" perspective. If you do not have it, you\'re likely still missing [EGit](http://www.eclipse.org/egit/).

Then clone this Git repository: https://github.com/subshare/subshare.git


$H$H$H$H Step 3: Import projects

Open the \"Java\" perspective and click in the main menu on \"File\" => \"Import...\". Select \"Maven\" / \"Existing Maven Projects\".
Search for the projects in your Git working copy and import \"org.subshare.*\".

If you do not find \"Maven\" here, you might still need to install [m2e](http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/).


$H$H$H$H Step 4: DataNucleus Eclipse Plug-in

Install the [DataNucleus](http://www.datanucleus.org) Eclipse Plug-in, open the \"Java\" perspective, right-click the project
\"org.subshare.local\" in the \"Package Explorer\" view.

Then select \"DataNucleus\" => \"Add DataNucleus Support\". Finally, repeat the double-click on the same project and check
\"DataNucleus\" => \"Enable Auto-Enhancement\".
