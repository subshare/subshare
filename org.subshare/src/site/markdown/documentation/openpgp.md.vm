OpenPGP
-------

OpenPGP is a 20 years old standard primarily used for e-mail-encryption and code-signing.
For example, most GNU/Linux distributions use it to sign their installation packages.
 
OpenPGP primarily standardises the usage of public-key-cryptography, which can be used
to:

* Encrypt + decrypt
* Sign + verify


$H$H$H Public/private-key-pair

It is paramount to the understanding of subshare and OpenPGP to understand the
*basics* of public-key-cryptography.

Don't worry! These basics are easy to understand. It all boils down to so-called key-pairs,
each containing two keys: A *public key* and *a private key*:

![Key-pair](../images/openpgp/key-pair.svg)

As the name implies, the *public key* is available to everyone. It is usually published
onto a key-server for the world to see (and use).

The *private key* is kept secret and only available to its owner.


$H$H$H Private key vs. secret key

Because of its sensitive nature, a *private key* is usually protected by a passphrase
(a long password). Protecting it means to encrypt it (using this passphrase).
The *encrypted private key* is called *secret key*.

Only a person knowing the passphrase is able to decrypt the *secret key* and thus obtain the
(unprotected and usable) *private key*. The only person being able to do so is the key's owner.

Thus, in practice the public/private-key-pair looks like this:

![Key-pair with secret key](../images/openpgp/key-pair_with_secret_key.svg)

Only the yellow (*secret*) and the green (*public*) keys are stored in a file. The red (*private*)
key is only kept in memory.

The "Large Random Number" used to generate the keys is never stored. It is forgotten
immediately after key generation and should not be known by anyone (it's a secret, too).


$H$H$H Encrypt + decrypt

In order to *encrypt* a plain text, Bob uses Alice's *public key*.

To *decrypt* the ciphertext, later, Alice needs her corresponding *private key*.

Thus, everyone in the world can send an encrypted message to Alice, but only Alice can decrypt
it â€” she's the only person having access to her private key.


$H$H$H Sign + verify

In order to *sign* data, Alice uses her *private key*. Only she alone has access to it.

Bob then uses Alice's *public key* to verify the signature. If the data was manipulated
by an attacker, he'd detect the broken signature.
