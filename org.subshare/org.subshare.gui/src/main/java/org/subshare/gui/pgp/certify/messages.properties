#CertifyPgpKeyPane.headerText.text=Everyone can generate a PGP key for "George Orwell <orwell@email.com>". \

#You must verify the key yourself\! That's most reliable. Alternatively, you can rely on others \
#certifying the key's authenticity.\
#\n\n\
#Please ask the key's owner to give you his PGP key's fingerprint personally (e.g. printed on a business card)\!
