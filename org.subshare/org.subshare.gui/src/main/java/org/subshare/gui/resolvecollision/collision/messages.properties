You need to manually check the collided files, i.e. compare its contents manually. \
If a bad version survived and your preferred version was overwritten, \
please restore the good version (it's in the history - don't worry!) by overwriting the current version.

CollisionPane.resolvedCheckBox.text=Resolved!
CollisionPane.resolvedCheckBox.tooltip.text=This collision is resolved.\n\nThis means, the current version is fine and this collision \
should not be highlighted any longer.\nIt stays visible in the history, though, and it may be marked as not resolved again, later.
