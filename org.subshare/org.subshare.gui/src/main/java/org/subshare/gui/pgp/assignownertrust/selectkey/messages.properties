SelectKeyPane.headerText.text=Do you want to assign the same owner-trust to all keys of this user? Or to a specific subset (selected below) only?\
\n\n\
Most of the time, it makes sense to assign the same owner-trust to all keys of a user. However, if you know that \
the user treats some of his keys as "low-security" and others as "high-security" or for other reasons he normally never uses \
certain keys for certifications, you should assign different owner-trust appropriately.
