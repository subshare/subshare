ExportBackupDestinationPane.headerText.text=In which destination directory should we write the backup?\
\n\n\
It is urgently recommended to select a directory on a USB stick or another EXTERNAL DEVICE! Alternatively, \
you can burn the backup to a CD/DVD, later. But you must store the backup on a separate device\! \
Every device breaks sooner or later\!\
\n\n\
So please\n\
* connect an external storage device now,\n\
* mount it (if needed),\n\
* click the refresh-button, below,\n\
* and select a directory on this external device\!
