Q: Isn't all my data in the cloud? Why do I need to do a backup, then?\
\n\n\
Certain data must be present locally, before you can access your cloud's data. Most of your \
data is indeed in your virtual locker. But you cannot access a locker without knowing its address and having its key.\
\n\n\
In contrast to a physical locker, which might be opened with heavy machinery, when the key is lost, there is really no way to get your data \
without your OpenPGP key. Your digital locker is more an extension to your mind than a physical thing. And just \
like nobody should be able to read your thoughts, nobody should be able to read your data\! Ever\!\
\n\n\
Since it is IMPOSSIBLE to recover your key without reading it from a prior backup, it means: IF YOU LOSE YOUR PGP KEY \
and you have no backup, then YOU LOSE ALL YOUR DATA\!\!\!\
\n\n\
So better backup, now. And make sure, you write it onto a physically separate device (external disk or USB stick). \
We recommend, you backup onto a dedicated USB stick and put it into a safe \
place (e.g. a key box).\
\n\n\
Please note, that your PGP secret key is written in its passphrase-protected form. Thus, if anyone gets access to your \
backup, he still cannot access your PGP private key without knowing your passphrase.\
\n\n\
On the other hand, this means, your backup will not help you, if you forget your passphrase! If you LOSE ONE OF THEM, then YOU LOSE ALL\!
