SearchCriteriaPane.headerText.text=Import PGP keys from your servers.\
\n\n\
To protect the data (i.e. to prevent spammers from collecting e-mail-addresses), \
you must enter a complete e-mail-address, here. It is not sufficient, to specify only a part of it.\
\n\n\
You can also specify the entire PGP-user-identity. This is necessary, if the identity does not contain an \
e-mail-address; otherwise the e-mail-address is sufficient -- and recommended.\
\n\n\
You cannot search by first or last name alone (unless the searched PGP-user-identity contains nothing else).

SearchCriteriaPane.queryStringLabel.text=E-mail-address (or user-identity):

SearchResultPane.headerText[searching].text=Searching for PGP keys matching "%s"...
SearchResultPane.headerText[found].text=The following PGP keys were found matching "%s". Please select one or more keys to be imported.
SearchResultPane.headerText[notFound].text=No PGP key was found matching "%s"!\
\n\n\
Please make sure that you search for a complete e-mail-address or a complete PGP-user-identity. A partial search is NOT \
allowed in order to protect the data (i.e. to prevent spammers from collecting e-mail-addresses).
