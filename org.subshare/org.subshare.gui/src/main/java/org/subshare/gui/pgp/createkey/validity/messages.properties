ValidityPane.headerText.text=How long do you want your new OpenPGP key to stay valid?\
\n\n\
If you are unsure, just leave the default value. To expire the OpenPGP key in 10 years is probably a\
 good compromise: 10 years is such a long time for switching the OpenPGP keys that it's not too bothersome\
 while at the same time, it should still be safe enough: When using the strongest security algorithms known\
 today - which we do by default -, chances are high that they are still secure enough in 10 years.
