UserIdPane.headerText.text=Every OpenPGP key has at least one so-called "user identity" associated.\
\n\n\
Here, you can modify (or add / remove) the identities to be associated with the new OpenPGP key. \
Typically, every identity consists of a name and an e-mail-address, but you can omit either one of them. \
Note, though, that if you do not specify any e-mail-address, you won't be able to use the OpenPGP key for \
signing/encrypting e-mails.\
\n\n\
Note, that you can add further identities later, but you cannot remove identities.
