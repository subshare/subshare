UserIdPane.headerText.text=Every OpenPGP key has at least one so-called "user identity" associated.\
\n\n\
Here, you can modify (or add / remove) the identities to be associated with the new OpenPGP key.\n\
Typically, every identity consists of a name and an e-mail-address, but you can omit the e-mail-addresses,\n\
if you don't intend to use the OpenPGP key for signing/encrypting e-mails.\
\n\n\
Note, that you can add further identities later, but you cannot remove identities.
