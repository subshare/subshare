SelectOwnerTrustPane.headerText.text=How much do you trust this user in his role as notary certifying other keys?\
\n\n\
In order to judge this person, you should answer the following questions:\
\n\n\
- How well does this person understand the roles of private and public keys?\
\n\n\
- How well does this person protect his computer's integrity and most importantly his private key(s)?\
\n\n\
- How well does this person check the authenticity of another key before signing (= certifying) it?\
\n\n\
Whether you trust this person on a personal level, should have only a minor influence on the owner-trust. For \
example, you certainly trust your mother, but unless she's really computer-savvy, you likely assign a low owner-trust \
to her key.
