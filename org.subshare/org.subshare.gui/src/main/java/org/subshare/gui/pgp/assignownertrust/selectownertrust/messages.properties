SelectOwnerTrustPane.explanationText.text=In order to judge this person, you should consider the following questions:\
\n\n\
- How well does this person understand the roles of private and public keys?\
\n\n\
- How well does this person protect his computer's integrity and most importantly his private key(s)?\
\n\n\
- How well does this person check the authenticity of another key before signing (= certifying) it?\
\n\n\
- Would this person certify a key in bad faith?\
\n\n\
Whether you trust this person on a personal level, should have only a minor influence on the owner-trust. For \
example, you likely trust your mother blindly, but unless she's really computer-savvy, you should still assign a low owner-trust \
to her key.
