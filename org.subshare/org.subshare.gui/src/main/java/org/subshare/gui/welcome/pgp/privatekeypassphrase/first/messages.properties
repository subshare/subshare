FirstPane.headerText.text=Welcome to Subshare!\
\n\n\
It seems this is the first time you start this program - or at least a few things still need to be set up.\
\n\n\
We found an existing OpenPGP key pair. Subshare is based on OpenPGP: It uses it to reliably identify users \
as well as to encrypt data.\
\n\n\
Therefore, Subshare is going to ask you for the passphrases of all existing OpenPGP private keys. If you do not wish to \
use one of them (or you forgot the passphrase) simply cancel the dialog.\
\n\n\
If you choose not to use any of your existing keys, Subshare is going to create a new identity (= OpenPGP key pair) for you.\
\n\n\
Have fun using this software!\

And if you have questions, please consult the documentation online. If you still don't find what you're looking for, \
you're welcome to ask your question in the forum.
